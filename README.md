# **List of books in minimalistic design**

## Requirements
1. The application is built using _create-react-app_.
2. The list page displays    
   - Title
   - Author
   - Publication Date
   - Genre
3. The list page has a search bar that allows the user to search for books by title or author.
4. The detail page displays the details of a single book, including:
    - Title
    - Author
    - Publication Date
    - Genre
    - Description
   **and in addition Image.**
5. The detail page has a **Home button** (back button) that takes the user back to the list page.
6. The application retrieves the book data from an **internal** JSON file.
7. The application uses React Router to handle routing between the list and detail pages **(HashRouter, Routes, Route + Link).**
8. The application is responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices, have tested on different mobile devices with **Google Chrome device toolbar**.
9. **I made the application as well organized and easy to read as possible, named the variables so that it is clear what they are used for.**

## Bonus Points
1. _If I understand correctly: I use Hooks to manage sorting, filtering_
2. ----------
3. The page has filtering by genre
4. ----------
5. **Have added sorting on the main page by title and author**
6. **Thead in table is fixed during sorting (sticky), very convenient if there is a lot of data, or when viewing through a mobile device**
